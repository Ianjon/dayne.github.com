Markdown has become my default Markup language after GitHub went to making it the path of least resistance in their land.  Textile was a contender for a few years but I kept finding myself bouncing between the two often enough the markup syntax was turning into a slot machine in my brain.  I ended up relying on `cheat markdown` and `cheat textile` to get even the most basic work done.

Now that I've sad back and found myself defaulting to Markdown I'm finding a few things that make me sad:

* GitHub's markdown is not the same as what I'm using on my local box
* They've added a bunch of features I appriciate but no hints as to how to make them all work locally
*
