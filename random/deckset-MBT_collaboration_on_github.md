# what is GitHub

"GitHub is a Git repository web-based hosting service which offers all of the functionality of Git as well as adding many of its own features. Unlike Git which is strictly a command-line tool, Github provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration." -- wikipedia

# what is Git

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.

# so really what is it?

A web based collaboration platform and hosting platform for code, documents, and websites.

---

# Why not Dropbox, Box, or a shared storage area

---

# Costs:

* Public repository - Free
* Private repository - monthly fee - GINA has over 100 private repos at GitHub.

*Private repo not needed for MBT*

---

# Gotchas

* Yet another username and password
* Not useful for hosting large binary files - Git doesn't handle those well
  * this is not a solution for distributing or tracking of the UAV based imagery or video.

---

# Who is using it?

* Everybody!
* The whitehouse: https://github.com/whitehouse
* ESRI, NASA, GINA, SNAP, ...

# How would MBT use it?

---

# Already using it


---

# Next proposed use: Public Website

Use the GitHub web sites and public repo capabilities to store the 'published/public' documents, workflows, scripts, and other parts we want to interate on over the next three years.

Create a (insert name of thing here).github.io website we can have as the long term community website that can live beyond the 3 year project.

---

# Who would use it?

Lead would be Patrick with support from other GINA staff.  MBT admins would all be granted access to modify and update.
