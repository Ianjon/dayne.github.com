## regular expressions ##

[Rubular](http://rubular.com) is a [Ruby regular expression editor](http://rubular.com/) that helps learning and testing your ruby regular expessions. I wish Rubular had been around 10 years ago.

Try out these regular expressions:
```
\d\d\w+
^\d\d\w+
\d\d\ ?\w+
\d\d\ \w+
```

using this test string:
```
You are 403 feet away from my 73 taco.  
If you try to steal my 73taco whip you
82 times and brand you as the infamous
73taco stealer. 
```
