Stop putting up artificial barriers to working with others.  Pick and use online collaboration tools that encourage engagement and contributions.

I've found the following to be very handy online collaboration tools:

## GitHub

[GitHub](http://github.com) - Collaborate on code, documents, everything!

## BaseCamp

[Basecamp](http://basecamp.com) - collaborate on projects!

## Google Docs

[Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) - collaborate on words! Stop tossing around .docx files as email attachments right now.

## Share your screen

Show people what you are seeing.

* [Google Hangouts](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1660627?hl=en) can do this.  
* [join.me](http://join.me) - Primary tool I use for screen sharing at work
* [tmux]() -
  * [share terminal](http://readystate4.com/2011/01/02/sharing-remote-terminal-session-between-two-users-with-tmux/)
  * [tmate.io](http://tmate.io/)
