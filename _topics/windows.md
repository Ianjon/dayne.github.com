# Windows Systems

I've spent a long time with a love/hate .. more hate and very little love for Windows through my carrerr.  Windows holds a special spot for gaming but beyond that it has mostly spent it's time trying to crush my soul.

However, lately Microsoft appears to be pointing the Windows platform in a generally good direction by embracing key approaches (or atleast not squashing communities building good things) that make windows better.

Towards this end I've decided to embrace Windows in my brain by collecting the set of tools I think people need to function nicely on Windows in the hopes I can chef the install of these sometime in the future.
