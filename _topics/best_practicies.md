This is a list of a few best practices I hope to apply to myself and recommend to friends.  Reality is these are my goals and many times not a reality (yet).

# Avoid Suck

Remember nobody wants to deal with suck - but usually the default unless you and others work on something ends up being sucky.

## Collaborate

Remember you aren't the only one wanting to make life better for yourself and others.  Sometimes you can be surprised at who else wants to join and what they can contribute.  Make it easy for others to collaborate with you even if it creates a bit more friction in your day-to-day life.

I have a whole page on [collaboration tools](/topics/collaboration.html).

# Read Things

Here are a few things I've read over the years that helped course correct myself:

* The Phoenix Project
  * How to not make IT suck for yourself an d others - this is written as as story and if you've been in the trenches of IT it can *hurt* to read the first half of this book as you read the reflection of the challanges you've faced as an IT person.
* Pragmatic Programmers
  * Programming is hard - being a good programmer is an art form (that I've personally not mastered but respect and rely on).

# Email

I lose at email.  At some point in 2009 I started drowning in it and I realized I can't follow up at the engagement level I expected of myself.  This is why I love collaboration tools, like BaseCamp and GitHub, that capture and open up engagement to a wider audience.

However email is core communication utility and when I do follow up I try to have the following approach plan:

* Know what the topic or the goal of the thread before creating or replying to it
  * Stay on topic - random questions or seperate topics should go into a new thread
  * If the topic/goal of the thread is fuzzy to you try to reframe what you think it might be and ask the thread to confirm - many times that will provide clarity to yourself and others.
* Have a thesis statement or question you pose at the top of your email (and description)
* Make the email description exactly that: descriptive and relevant to the goal of thread
* Avoid writing a huge block of text - new paragraphs are great for organizing  thoughts and helps others scan the email for the key points.
  * The return key is your friend and will only make your emails easier to parse for others.
* Write in complete thoughts
  * For me this means re-reading at-least once since my thinking method can leave me with half fleshed out paragraphs/sentances


# CHANGELOG

  Curate a log of the *notible* changes in projects in your life.  

  Not just code projects but the other projects you participate in work and life : platforms, partnerships, and organizations (I should have kept a CHANGELOG for [GINA](http://gina.alaska.edu) over the last 10 years).  Think of it as a journal you share so others who want to work with you can track progress and better collaborate with you.

# Semantic Versioning

  You of course have a revision control and data management plan for any content handle in life.  *Right?*

  To keep straight for yourself and others the data you are providing you will want a sane version numbering system.  I personally fit into one of two buckets for my versioning:

  * date based : YYYY-MM-DD
    * Use only as much as you need, so if you expect to update no more than once or twice a year and never more than once a month use YYYY-MM
    * _note: use - or . as a separator_ : 2014.09 or 2014-09-13
  * version based : v3.2.0
    * This is well documented at: [SemVer.org](http://semver.org/)
