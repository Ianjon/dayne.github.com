# Vim

After bouncing around and enjoying all sorts of different editors
I always find myself being pulled back into vim (it really is
everywhere I find myself).

#### Plugin Manager

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) - plugin
manager for vim. I have a [d.init](https://github.com/dayne/d.init)
script to install it.  Make sure to run ``:PlugInstall`` to install
any new plugins you might like. See author's
[thoughts on vim plugs](http://junegunn.kr/2013/09/thoughts-on-vim-plugin-dependency/)

Plugins for vim:

* [Plug 'junegunn/goyo.vim'](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim)
  * Distraction Free Writing in vim
* [Plug 'junegunn/vim-emoji.vim'](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-emoji)
  * Who knows.. emoji in vim
