I absconded (supposed to be a one day borrow.. a week later) with a friends copy of "HTML5 and CSS3":http://pragprog.com/titles/bhh5/html5-and-css3  a "PragProg":http://pragprog.com book.

I was struck how the very last chapter, very last section of the book, dealing with how to encode video for the web was dealt with.  The gist:  this is a difficult topic, so just run this code:

{% highlight bash %}
ffmpeg -i input.mov
  -f webm -vcodec libvpx_vp8 -acodec libvorbis
  -ab 160000 -sameq
  output.webm
{% endhighlight %}
_tells me: webm is a container format (like matroska) and inside that shove vp8 for video codec and libvorbis for audio_

That simple example explained to me what I needed to know and inspired me to abscond with the book for week to yank out other gems of knowledge and evaluate if we needed a copy of this for "GINA":http://www.gina.alaska.edu/

* doctype to use for html5
@<!DOCTYPE html >@
* these html tags are *gone* (some of which I've been using)
@basefont, big, center, font, s, strike, tt, u@
* presentation elements killed (again, I've been using some of these)
@align, bgcolor, height, width, valign, hspace, vspace, border@
* @target@ is depricated on href!?  clearly I'm out of the loop 
* New HTML tags to help reduce the div/div/div/div of our websites. "silly sample":/random/html5-silly-sample.txt
@header, footer, nav, section, artile, aside, meter, progress@

The book is in the mail. .. i'll come back and add more later as I transition this page to html5.
