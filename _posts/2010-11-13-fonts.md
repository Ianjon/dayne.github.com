# Sweet Fonts

p(meta). 13 Nov 2010 - Fairbanks

My custom font provided by [typekit](http://typekit.com) pleased me, the little logo in the bottom right corner that showed up there because I'm using the free account not so much.  

This inspired me to get educated as to what is going on here. The super short of it:  TypeKit is providing: font licensing (actually rental), hosting, optimization for browsers (they make it go for IE).

This [zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com) guy had some very well written explanations of things:
* [zeldman's love hate affair with typekit](http://www.zeldman.com/2010/03/22/my-lovehate-affair-with-typekit/)
* [zeldmans' overview of web fonts and standards](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/08/17/web-fonts-and-standards/)

But it wasn't until I ran across Richard Fink's [Web Fonts at the Crossing](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fonts-at-the-crossing/) that I found the term for what TypeKit was.  A “font hosting and obfuscation” service. 

Finish reading Richard Fink's article and find my gut reaction was correct "\_this isn't the right path for me\_" but he provides the following happy points:
* There are thousands of fonts for free (open and legal).
* Google is [hosting](http://code.google.com/webfonts) some of them - and providing an [AJAX API](http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#webfont) to them
* [FontSquirrel's FontFace generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator) can take fonts you provide and prep them for usage
* The Google ajax api code here on [GitHub - WebFont Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) - that must mean it is good stuff right?

The [Google hosted](http://code.google.com/webfonts) are simple to get started with using their example code...see my [font import test.](/random/font\_import\_test.html)

In the end, Julie and I sat down and looked through a variety of cool, free fonts available from [fontsquirrel's fontface kits](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface) and she picked out a replacement for my TypeKit font I was using.   I made a backup of [trying out jekyll](/random/trying\_out\_jekyll.html) to see what I was talking about with the TypeKit applied to the site.

Installation of one of those kits was fairly simple:

* put an unzipped copy of the font in my /fonts directory
* made a copy of stylesheet.css as require.css
* removed extra version of the font I did not plan on using from require.css
* Add the [require.css](/fonts/orbitron/require.css) to the header:
 > ``` <link rel="stylesheet" href="/fonts/orbitron/require.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection" />  ```

* then reference it in my screen.css with:
 > <pre> font-family: 'OrbitronLight', Arial, sans-serif;</pre>

I am pleased.
