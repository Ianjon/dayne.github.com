_23 August 2011 - Fairbanks_

I managed to have Fedora 15 for about two weeks before I gave up on Gnome3 and then decided Xfce just isn't what I want for my laptop.  Gnome 3 is missing too many small customizations not letting me quickly get rid of annoyances.  

Ubuntu 11.04's Unity was a good laptop interface.  This post will be my notes of what customizations I did to make myself happy.

#### Chrome

[Google's Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) 64bit .deb for Ubuntu works great.  Just download and let it automatically install itself.

#### CapsLock key is dumb

Press the 'windows' key, type *keyboard* to get Keyboard Preferences control panel -> Layouts Tab -> Options button -> **Ctrl key position** -> Check *Make Caps Lock an additional Ctrl*

try doing that sanely in gnome 3

#### Select those windows

I'm a mouse over to focus guy.
Press the 'windows' key, type *windows* -> launch **Window Preferences** control panel -> check **Select windows when the mouse moves over them**

#### RVM

Get dependencies for rvm plus the system ruby (handy for root)

{% highlight bash %}
1.
sudo apt-get install curl git-core ruby irb
1.
bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)
1. automatically sets up your .bashrc so just
1. open a new terminal window to get rvm in your path
rvm notes
1. review their notes for ubuntu - I just want 1.9.2
sudo apt-get install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev automake
1. development dependencies hopefully installed correctly
rvm install 1.9.2
1. hopefully that works well - make it the default
rvm use 1.9.2 --default
{% endhighlight %}

#### Rubygems

There are a few rubygems I expect on all my systems:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install cheat     # command line cheat sheets
                      # http://cheat.errtheblog.com/
gem install getopt    # I'm ghetto like that
gem install highline  # stop rewriting 'ask()'
gem install trollop   # I need to stop being so ghetto
{% endhighlight %}

##### GIS tools (qgis gdal)

For work I need GIS stuff.  Getting the basics from apt is a good start.  Customized qgis and gdal can come later.  Default will hand you Qgis 1.4 (OUCH!) so make sure you setup the third party bleeding edge stuff. [official qgis ubuntu words](http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download#Ubuntu)

{% highlight bash %}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis qgis-mapserver python-qgis
1. this gets some dependancies I want like grass, proj, and others
sudo apt-get install gdal-bin dans-gdal-scripts
{% endhighlight %}
