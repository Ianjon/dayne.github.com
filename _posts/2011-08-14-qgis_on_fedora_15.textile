h1. {{page.title}}

p(meta). 08 August 2011 - Fairbanks

This is a follow up post to my "Installing QGIS from git on Fedora":/2011/07/21/qgis_from_git.html with the additional details/changes needed for Fedora 15.

h4. dependancies 

The old dependancies line almost is good enough but a few tweaks are needed.  The follow up line:

{% highlight bash %}
yum install sqlite-devel gsl-devel
{% endhighlight %}

h4. compiling

Fedora 15's cmake is a bit different than Fedora 14s.  Changed up from the menu system to fully command line parameter passing for this one.  For some reason the cmake .. was returning /libgdal.so instead of /usr/lib64/libgdal.so as it should have for yum installed gdal so I had to set the GDAL_LIBRARY:STRING variable.

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/qgis # changed up install location

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${HOME}/qgis -DGDAL_LIBRARY:STRING=/usr/lib64/libgdal.so ..
cmake -L # check out what it will be doing

make
make install
{% endhighlight %}
