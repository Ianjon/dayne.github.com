I have been on a mission to relearn and solidify my understanding of DC circuits and electricity. When getting my Computer Science degree I highly enjoyed the physics and electronic classes but I've found those neural pathways were pretty soggy.  Recent house improvements and home projects have prompted need for clear understanding of how to plan, wire, and test basic AC and DC curcuits. 

A few wonderful resources on this quest have been:

* [Theory of DC circuits](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-DC-Circuits-Electron-Flow/dp/1560483008) - I dont' recall where/when I picked this superb book on DC circuits up but it is amazing. Kicks you off in Chapter 1 with _"The ancient Greeks discovered two kinds of electricity..."_.  I love it.
* [resistors for led](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2012/resistors-for-leds/) explains why you need resistors for LEDs walks you through how to calculate it manually with Ohms law. 
* [resistors - deep dive](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/resistors) - a good deep dive into resistors by the good folks at [SparkFun](sparkfun.com)
* [Choosing a Resister](http://www.instructables.com/id/Choosing-The-Resistor-To-Use-With-LEDs/) - This wonderful instructable has a link to the following wizarrds:
  * [LED calculator](http://led.linear1.org/1led.wiz) - calculate what size of resistor a single LED needs for a source voltage.
  * [LED series/parallel array wizard](http://led.linear1.org/1led.wiz) - calculate needed resisters and wiring options a set of LEDs in series or parallel.
* [Resistor Color Code Calculator](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/resistor-color-code-calculator/) - handy calculator for reading resitor color codes

_What have I been doing so far?_

Learning the basics. Walker was nice enough to give me a [MAKER Soldering Kit](http://www.makershed.com/collections/soldering-tools). Not only did this kit provide me a good soldering iron but it also came with some a set of great learning [Maker Robot](http://makezine.com/projects/maker-faire-2012-electronic-skill-badge/) skill badge. My first attempt failed, second worked, and I went back and could fix the first badge. Great fun.

Followed on by building my own [fume extractor](http://www.darbinorvar.com/blog/2015/10/6/desktop-air-purifier-fume-extractor).  That worked out well but wasn't as pretty as Darbin's.

This was followed up by my real soldering project goal: Soldering together a [Digital Oscilloscope kit](https://www.amazon.com/JYE-DSO-138-Open-Source/dp/B00WAQGGZA). This was an epic project to tackle. This forced me to sort, test, and solder many different components. Really helped me nail down identifying and testing with a multimeter resistors.  Start to finish it took me about 6 hours to put together a $25 digital oscilloscope.

Happy hardware hacking!
