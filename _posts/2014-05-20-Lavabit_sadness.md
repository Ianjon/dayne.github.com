# Legal evil used against Lavabit

_May 21st 2014_

[This run down](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email)
by Lavabit founder, Ladar Levison, on
why lavabit shutdown after the Snowden email has
a section that makes me rage and cry on the inside
because of how insidiously evil it shows how the court
system can be used by the government against the people:

> Then, a federal judge entered an order of contempt
> against me **without even so much as a hearing.**
>
> But the judge created a loophole: without a hearing,
> I was never given the opportunity to object, let
> alone make any any substantive defense, to the
> contempt change. Without any objection (because I
> wasn't allowed a hearing), the appellate court waived
> consideration of the substantive questions my case
> raised â€“ and upheld the contempt charge, on the
> grounds that I hadn't disputed it in court. Since the
> US supreme court traditionally declines to review
> decided on wholly procedural grounds,
> **I will be permanently denied justice.**

Ladar ends with the following advice:

> courts must not be allowed to consider matters of
> great importance under the shroud of secrecy, lest we
> find ourselves summarily deprived of meaningful due
> process.

I second that.  Secrecy in the court system should be
considered a cancer and fought as aggressively as
possible by those that want the whole system to live.
