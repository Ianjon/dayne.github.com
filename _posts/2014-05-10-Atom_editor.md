# Atom Editor

Well this last week a pleasant surprise came out.
[GitHub](https://github.com) released their next
generation programming  editor from beta
[Atom Editor](http://atom.io) as  open source.

I had pulled down atom as a beta testor a while
back but didn't stop and really try to use it since
I typically live in vim in those rare moments I
find myself trying to code these days.  Google Docs
is where I live most of the time these days. Since I
last looked their is now a vim keybindings plugin
and **it worked**.

This post was written in Atom and the best thing ever
 during this is the markdown preview pane.

Now I've got a handy preview pane to let me know
if I'm remembering my markdown syntax correctly
and extra bonus is there is a spell checker built
into atom editor that give me the red squiggle of
of warning for me.

This functionality is super handy for the other
application I've been trying to add to my tool chest
a markdown based slideshow tool called
[Deckset](http://decksetapp.com) that
[teknofire](http://teknofire.net) showed me recently.

# Deckset

[Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/) (OSX only) 
takes a simple markdown document formatted
just right and turns it into a slideshow.  Weirdly
enough Deckset is magically aware of atom and when
open it will create a little preview pane overlay.

Exmple 3 slide Deckset markdown:

```markdown
# [fit] Welcome Slide

---

# [fit] Second Slide

## [damnitalex](http://damnitalex.com) time

```

I find myself wondering how much more I could integrate
markdown into my work related writing I end up doing.

Perhaps my next proposal I can do in the Atom Editor
with Markdown.  Fun times.
