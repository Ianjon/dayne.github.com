# 2014 Denali Rafting

![](/random/2014-rafting/DSC_9301-web.jpg)

This last summer we took advantage of a friend doing a return to Alaska visit to head down to the Denali and do a Nenana rafting session.  Erika, Kelli, Julie, Josh and I drove down from Fairbanks, hopped on the rafting bus, spent 4 hours on the river, grabbed dinner, and then crashed in a local hotel

A few things I learned:

* Do the 4 hour session - I was sad for the folks who did the 2 hour session - they missed out in some of the more fun parts of the river.
* A cloudy/overcast day is a bonus - I think I might have melted into sadness inside that dry suit on a sunny/hot day.
* Do the paddle version - having to paddle is way more fun and engaging than the version where the guide did the paddling.
* Have a dinner reservation made - you'll be hungry.
* Have a hotel/room to crash in - you won't want to get in the car and drive after rafting and dinner.
* The photos are probably worth it - I did the USB version and shared the cost.
